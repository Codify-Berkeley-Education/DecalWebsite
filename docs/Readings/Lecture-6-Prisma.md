# Lecture 6: Prisma

## Additional Resources

I have found that by far the best resources on the internet for understanding Prisma is their own documentation. When getting started, check out the [Prisma playground](https://playground.prisma.io/examples/reading/find/find-all?host=playground.prisma.io&path=examples) to see interactive examples of almost everything you can do in Prisma. Each code example in the playground is linked to more information about the concept in the [Prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs).

- [Comprehensive Prisma Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RebA5J-rlwg) if a video is more your style, Web Dev Simplified also has a great comprehensive tutorial.
