# Lecture 1: Getting Started and Git Basics

## Motivation and What is Git?

Git enables multiple (or thousands of) people to safely collaborate on the same codebase without accidentally overwriting each other's changes. It also automatically tracks who did what and when within a codebase. If you ever want to work on any code with other people, learning git is a necessity. This lecture will walk through the most widely used operations and give a working high level overview of how to use git effectively. For more in depth coverage of the subject matter, the best online resources are the [Atlassian Git Tutorials](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials) and the [Pro Git Book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) on the git documentation site.
