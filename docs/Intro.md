# Welcome to the Codify Education Program!

This program was created prepare students to work on Codify projects, and to give them the fundamental skills required to build any application they desire. We loosely cover the [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg/) because it has end to end type safety (don't worry if you have no idea what I'm talking about), but we try and focus on larger principles that apply to any tech stack. Additionally, we try and connect the decisions you make with your software and design choices to their real world business impacts.

This is our first semester running the education program in this format, and we welcome any and all feedback on assignments, lectures, and readings. However, please keep in mind that it is largely just two students running a completely open access course.

All course materials is under the course content tab. Please make sure to read through our course policies, and officially sign up for the program through the form on the enroll tab.
