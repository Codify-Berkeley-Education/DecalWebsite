# Assignment 3: Prisma Basics

## Introduction

This assignment will get you familiar with the basics of Prisma, an object relational model for that makes it easier to work with databases. You will get the chance to perform all of the standard database operations or Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD).

You will be maniuplating two databases for this assignment, users.db and static.db. You will perform Create, Update, and Delete operations on users.db, while you will only perform read operations on static.db. We have created this division so that if you "mess up" any create, update, or delete operations to the users.db, we will only check to make sure that certain users do exists, don't exist,

# Part 0: Reading from a database

# Part 1: Adding to the database schema
