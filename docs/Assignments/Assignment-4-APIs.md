## Assignment Overview

Before completing this assignment, be sure to look over the Lecture 4 readings. They will provide key background information and context that will be useful for this assignment.

In this assignment, you will build out the functionality of a simple CLI application to generate a Spotify playlist recommended songs based on a user's favorite songs, albums, and artists. You will use the Spotify API to get data about available songs, artists, and albums, and recommended songs. You will use your own json-server to store a user's favorite songs, and the playlists Spotify generates.
