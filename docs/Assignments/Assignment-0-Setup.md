# Assignment 0: Setup for The Course

## Purpose and Goals

This assignment will not be turned in, and simply walks you through all of the steps needed to get your computer and IDE set up for the course. Shoot to finish the assignment before the first lecture.

## Actually Enroll In the Course

If you have not already, submit the google form found under the enroll tab. Also read the course policies!

## Accounts to Create

1. [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) if you don't already have one. Be sure to use a personal email address.
2. [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io) will be used to allow you to follow along with lecture code.

## Things to install on your computer

1. [Visual Studio Code (Same IDE used in CS61A)](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
2. [Git Version Control Software](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
3. [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

## Things to join

1. [Gradescope section, join code RKXBW4](https://www.gradescope.com/)
2. [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/seFp4RgnZ4)

Once in the discord server, navigate to the #join-bootcamp chanel and click the book reaction to self assign yourself the Bootcamp Member roll. We will be using discord for the majority of important course communication and for Q and A.

## Useful VS Code Extensions

VS Code extensions can be installed by clicking on the extensions icon on the left sidebar. Extensions add functionality to your IDE and improve the developer experience. We will periodically recommend installing certain extensions for working with certain languages/frameworks once we encounter them in the course, but these extensions are useful from day one.

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/): An absolute necessity. It automagically formats your code to look beautiful every time you save.
2. Code Spell Checker: Is useful if you can't spel like me.
3. CodeSandBox: Allows you to edit your sandboxes inside your local IDE.
4. GitLens: Gives detailed inline information about commit histories.
5. Microsoft Live Share: Allows you to turn your VS Code instance into a google doc, and invite anyone to edit using just a link.

## That's it!

You are now ready to get started on our first lecture. If you have any questions about setup, ask them in the discord server so that other students can see our answers.
