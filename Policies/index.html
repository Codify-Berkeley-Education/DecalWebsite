It serves the dual purpose of preparing prospective Codify members for work on project teams, and screening prospective members for their level of commitment and ability to learn and apply technical skills. The program is meant for students with some prior programming experience (roughly equivalent to CS 61A or AP Computer Science A) but there is no strictly enforced requirement. The estimated time commitment for this course is 6-10 hours per week, broken down into 2 hours of lecture, 1-2 hour of supplemental reading/videos, and 3-7 hours on assignments. The time required to complete assignments will likely be highly dependent on your prior experience and comfort with the course content. Additionally, towards the end of the semester you will be asked to complete a final project, which will likely increase the time commitment required for the course for the last 3-4 weeks.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="course-content">Course Content<a href="#course-content" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Course Content" title="Direct link to Course Content">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="lectures">Lectures<a href="#lectures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Lectures" title="Direct link to Lectures">​</a></h3><p>Lectures will take place Tuesday-Thursday from 7-8pm. The first few weeks of lecture will be online, until attendance numbers stabilize and classroom availability increases. We hope to shift lectures to in person as within the first month of the program. Attendance will be taken via a secret word that will be revealed during lecture. In order to gain automatic acceptance into Codify or a preferential application (see Grade Breakdown) students must have no more than two unexcused absences throughout the program. There is no limit to the number of excused absences, but all excused absences must be submitted through a google form before the lecture begins. Acceptable reasons for an excused absence include a midterm exam time conflict, personal medical issue or illness, or significant personal or academic commitment. All lectures will be recorded and released on the course website.</p><p>All lectures will be about 40% explaining concepts through slides and 60% live demonstrations that you are expected to follow along with on your own personal laptop. Our goal is to make lectures as hands on as possible, and to work you through exercises that can be used for later reference when working on assignments and the final project. We will not require you to turn in any of the code you write during lecture.</p><p>In addition to a secret word, some lectures may have mini-vitamin quizzes released on gradescope. These multiple choice quizzes are meant to reinforce the key ideas of the course. They will have infinite submissions and will be due at midnight the day after the lecture. If a lecture has a mini-vitamin, it must be completed with a full score in order to get the attendance points for the lecture and not get an absence.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="readings">Readings<a href="#readings" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Readings" title="Direct link to Readings">​</a></h3><p>Readings provide additional information and exercises to help students better understand the content. There is no grade associated with the readings, but they help provide additional information that will make completing the assignments easier. There is no official recommendation on whether or not to complete the readings before or after the lecture, as that will be up to personal preference.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="assignments">Assignments<a href="#assignments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Assignments" title="Direct link to Assignments">​</a></h3><p>All programming assignments will be turned in through GitHub classroom. Some other assignments and attendance will be tracked through gradescope. Most assignments are auto graded, and the auto grader score will represent the final score on the assignment. For assignments without an auto grader, manual grades will be added to gradescope.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="final-project">Final Project<a href="#final-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Final Project" title="Direct link to Final Project">​</a></h3><p>The last assignment of the semester will be a final project that implements all of the skills learned throughout the semester. Students will have the choice of either completing a pre-approved final project with specific requirements, or proposing their own project that must satisfy a general set of requirements. All final projects must be accompanied by a live presentation and demonstration during dead week. Students are allowed and encouraged to complete the project in a group of two, but may work individually if they want.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="student-support">Student Support<a href="#student-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Student Support" title="Direct link to Student Support">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="discord">Discord<a href="#discord" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Discord" title="Direct link to Discord">​</a></h3><p>All important course communication will be on the Codify Discord server. Please check it regularly for updates. Important announcements may also be sent out via email. Please also use discord to ask any course content or assignment related questions, so that other students will be able to see the questions and responses.</p><p>Within the Codify Discord Server, please change your display name to just your first and last name so that we know who you are when answering questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="office-hours">Office Hours<a href="#office-hours" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Office Hours" title="Direct link to Office Hours">​</a></h3><p>In person office hours support will be held multiple times per week.

The instructors may give extensions in rare cases, but there is no guarantee of an extension on any assignment.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grade-breakdown">Grade Breakdown<a href="#grade-breakdown" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grade Breakdown" title="Direct link to Grade Breakdown">​</a></h3><p>While the education program is not an official university recognized course, Codify still issues a final grade percentage in the course for the purpose of offering acceptance into the organization following the completion of the program. There are three relevant grade bins a student can fall into: automatic acceptance, preferred application, and no application benefit. Students who earn 95% of all possible points will be automatically invited to join the Codify fellowship program or a client project team. Students who earn 85% of all possible points are not automatically guaranteed acceptance, but are given preferential consideration in applying for the Codify fellowship program. Students who earn less than 85% of all possible points will still have learned a great deal of full stack skills which will bolster their application to Codify, but they are not given any preferential treatment over other applicants.</p><div style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><table><tr><td>Attendance</td><td>10%</td></tr><tr><td>Assignments</td><td>60%</td></tr><tr><td>Final Project</td><td>30%</td></tr></table></div><p>Numerous extra credit opportunities will be offered on assignments during the semester, and on the final project.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="academic-honesty-and-use-of-ai-code-generation">Academic Honesty and Use of AI Code Generation<a href="#academic-honesty-and-use-of-ai-code-generation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Academic Honesty and Use of AI Code Generation" title="Direct link to Academic Honesty and Use of AI Code Generation">​</a></h2><p>Use of any online resources to assist with an assignment or completing a project is allowed. If you find a particularly useful resource, we encourage you to share it in the #resource-sharing channel. Students are encouraged to work together on assignments and help each other think through the process, but each student must write up their own solution. You are allowed to show your code to another student so that they can offer advice or help debug, but you may not directly copy another students solution exactly.</p><p>Use of Chat-GPT, GitHub Copilot, and other AI software in this course is allowed. That being said, it is recommended that you only add code to your assignments and projects that you understand. This will make debugging easier and contribute better to your long term learning. My personal recommendation is to try and avoid using AI software on the assignments, as they are meant to build fundamental skills, and to use it extensively on the final project, as understanding how to use AI efficiently to increase your productivity on a large scale project is increasingly becoming an important software skill.</p></article></div><div class="col col--2"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#overview" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#course-content" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Course Content</a><ul><li><a href="#lectures" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Lectures</a></li><li><a href="#readings" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Readings</a></li><li><a href="#assignments" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Assignments</a></li><li><a href="#final-project" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Final Project</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#student-support" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Student Support</a><ul><li><a href="#discord" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Discord</a></li><li><a href="#office-hours" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Office Hours</a></li><li><a href="#personal-logistical-questions-and-concerns" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Personal Logistical Questions and Concerns</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#grading" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Grading</a><ul><li><a href="#late-work" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Late Work</a></li><li><a href="#grade-breakdown" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Grade Breakdown</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#academic-honesty-and-use-of-ai-code-generation" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Academic Honesty and Use of AI Code Generation</a></li></ul></div></div></div></main></div><footer class="footer footer--dark"><div class="container container-fluid"><div class="row footer__links"><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Docs</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a class="footer__link-item" href="/DecalWebsite/docs/intro">Tutorial</a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">Community</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://discord.com/invite/NHnmN7ks7F" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Codify Discord<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/codifyberkeley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Codify Instagram<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div><div class="col footer__col"><div class="footer__title">More</div><ul class="footer__items clean-list"><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://codifyberkeley.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Main Codify Website<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li><li class="footer__item"><a href="https://github.com/Codify-Club-Berkeley" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="footer__link-item">Codify GitHub<svg width="13.5" height="13.5" aria-hidden="true" viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="iconExternalLink_nPIU"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21 13v10h-21v-19h12v2h-10v15h17v-8h2zm3-12h-10.988l4.035 4-6.977 7.07 2.828 2.828 6.977-7.07 4.125 4.172v-11z"></path></svg></a></li></ul></div></div><div class="footer__bottom text--center"><div class="footer__copyright">Maintained by Codify Berkeley, Build with Docusaurus</div></div></div></footer></div>
