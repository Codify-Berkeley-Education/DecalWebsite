# Codify Education Program Policies

## Overview

The Codify Education Program is designed to teach the basics of full stack web and mobile development, using a tech stack that is both easy to pick up and can scale to enterprise level applications. It serves the dual purpose of preparing prospective Codify members for work on project teams, and screening prospective members for their level of commitment and ability to learn and apply technical skills. The program is meant for students with some prior programming experience (roughly equivalent to CS 61A or AP Computer Science A) but there is no strictly enforced requirement.

## Course Content

### Lectures

Lectures will take place Tuesday-Thursday from 7-8pm. The first few weeks of lecture will be online, until attendance numbers stabilize. We hope to shift lectures to in person as within the first month of the program. Attendance will be taken via a secret word that will be revealed during lecture. In order to gain automatic acceptance into Codify or a preferential application (see Grade Breakdown) students must have no more than two unexcused absences throughout the program. There is no limit to the number of excused absences, but all excused absences must be submitted through a google form before the lecture begins. Acceptable reasons for an excused absence include a midterm exam time conflict, personal medical issue or illness, or significant personal or academic commitment. All lectures will be recorded and released on the course website.

### Readings

Readings provide additional information and exercises to help students better understand the content. There is no grade associated with the readings, but they help provide additional information that will make completing the assignments easier.

### Assignments

All programming assignments will be turned in through GitHub classroom. Some other assignments and attendance will be tracked through gradescope. Most assignments are auto graded, and the auto grader score will represent the final score on the assignment. For assignments without an auto grader, manual grades will be added to gradescope.

### Final Project

The last assignment of the semester will be a final project that implements all of the skills learned throughout the semester. Students will have the choice of either completing a pre-approved final project with specific requirements, or proposing their own project that must satisfy a general set of requirements. All final projects must be accompanied by a live presentation and demonstration during dead week. Students are allowed and encouraged to complete the project in a group of two, but may work individually if they want.

## Student Support

### Discord

All important course communication will be on the Codify Discord server. Please check it regularly for updates. Important announcements may also be sent out via email. Please also use discord to ask any course content or assignment related questions, so that other students will be able to see the questions and responses.

### Office Hours

In person office hours support will be held in the engineering library. The time and exact location of office hours within the engineering library will be posted on the course calendar. Specific details will be sent out week to week.

## Grading

### Late Work

All assignments may be turned in late, however there is a flat 20% grade penalty for each day late, such that a student will receive no credit for an assignment turned in five or more days late. The instructors may give extensions in rare cases, but there is no guarantee of an extension on any assignment.

### Grade Breakdown

While the education program is not an official university recognized course, Codify still issues a final grade percentage in the course for the purpose of offering acceptance into the organization following the completion of the bootcamp. There are three relevant grade bins a student can fall into: automatic acceptance, preferred application, and no application benefit. Students who earn 95% of all possible points will be automatically invited to join the Codify fellowship program or a client project team. Students who earn 85% of all possible points are not automatically guaranteed acceptance, but are given preferential consideration in applying for the Codify fellowship program. Students who earn less than 85% of all possible points will still have learned a great deal of full stack skills which will bolster their application to Codify, but they are not given any preferential treatment over other applicants.

Numerous extra credit opportunities will be offered on assignments during the semester, and on the final project.
