# Sign up for the Codify Education Program!

To officially sign up for the education program, just fill out our [enrollment form](https://forms.gle/5kLE19vrryW1Dne1A) with your Berkeley email address. The deadline to sign up is either September 7th, the day of the first lecture, at 7pm or whenever we finish releasing app Codify application decisions, whichever date is later. Before enrolling, please read the course policies.

Once you are enrolled, be sure to get started on the setup assignment and have it completed by the first lecture.

If you are not a current Berkeley student, you are still more than welcome to use all our course materials for your own personal learning. All slides, lecture recordings, and assignments will be made publicly available on the website. Many assignments have auto grader tests that can be run locally, but those that do not will have clearly written rubrics that can be used for self assessment.
